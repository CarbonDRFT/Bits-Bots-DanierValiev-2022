# The products are saved into firebase

I have chosen to store products in firebase, as I felt that would be a easier work
as I have done it before. Also created a admin page where new products can be added.

# Product images taken from www.gamestop.com

I got the permission to use the images from gamestop, screenshot will be provided inside github.
